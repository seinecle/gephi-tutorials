== Gephi workshops
I organize online workshops and personalized trainings for Gephi, for beginners and experts.
To schedule one or to get more information: analysis@exploreyourdata.com.

== download a network file for practice

link:../resources/miserables.zip[download this zip file] and unzip it on your computer.

or use this direct link: https://tinyurl.com/gephi-tuto-3[https://tinyurl.com/gephi-tuto-3]

You should find the file `miserables.gexf` in it. Save it in a folder you will remember (or create a folder specially for this small project).

//+

This file contains a network representing "who appears next to whom" in the 19th century novel _Les Misérables_ by Victor Hugofootnote:[D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993)].

A link between characters A and B means they appeared on the same page or paragraph in the novel.

The file name ends with ".gexf", which just means this is a text file where the network information is stored (name of the characters, their relations, etc.), following some conventions.


== open the network in Gephi
- open Gephi. On the Welcome screen that appears,  click on `Open Graph File`
- find `miserables.gexf` on your computer and open it

image::gephi-welcome-screen-open-graph-en.png[align="center", title="welcome screen"]

A report window will open, giving you basic info on the network you opened:

image::opening-file-report-en.png[align="center", title="report window"]

This tells you that the network comprises 74 characters, connected by 248 links.

Links are undirected, meaning that if A is connected to B, then it is the same as B connected to A.

The report also tells us the graph is not dynamic: it means there is no evolution or chronology, it won't "move in time".

Click on `OK` to see the graph in Gephi.

== getting a sense of the attributes in the data laboratory
We can switch to the data laboratory to see the underlying data:

We see that the nodes of the network have many attributes. In particular, each have a Gender and a measure of how central they are:

This is the list of edges (relations) in the network. Notice that they have a "weight" (a "strength").

== discovering the filter panel
In the overview, make sure the Filter panel is displayed:

How the Filter panel works:

An example: hiding edges with weight lower than 2

//PDF: {github-root}images/en/filter-edge-weight-en.gif[view online animation] - link: https://tinyurl.com/gephi-tuto-2

When you are finished using a filter in the zone, right click on it and select "remove".

== combining 2 filters
One filter is applied AFTER this other:

*The first filter to be applied is NESTED (placed inside) the second one as a "subfilter"*

Which filter should be placed inside which? Let's look at different examples:

==== 1. Case when the placement of filters makes no difference

Goal: Keeping on screen only the female characters which have a tie (an edge, a relation) of at least strength 2.

-> place the filter "edge weight" inside the filter "Gender":

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1TixDBp9-RQTYHioDEV4gbo0BN6cWWzKt8fkXl9So3Ds/pub?w=886&h=462[align="center",title="Filter on the Gender attribute"]

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EtqSByLSNOrGCW3nvlrTW7Oci8IBYQP2koZB1v4XTu0/pub?w=1015&h=695[align="center",title="Filter on edge weight"]

image::filter-edge-weight-gender-partition-en.gif[align="center",title="Keeping only female characters with at least 2 ties"]

//PDF: image::filter-edge-weight-gender-partition1-en.png[align="center",title="Keeping only female characters with at least 2 ties"]

//PDF: {github-root}images/en/filter-edge-weight-gender-partition-en.gif[view online animation] - link: https://tinyurl.com/gephi-tuto-1

In this case, it was equivalent to:

- nest the "Gender" filter inside the "Edge weight" filter

or

- nest the "Edge weight" filter inside the "Gender" Filter

-> The result was the same (the network on screen is identical in both cases)

==== 2. Case when the placement of filters makes a difference

Here, we want to visualize:

- only the nodes which have *less than* 10 relations  <1>
- and among these, only those which form the "main island" of the network (we want to hide small detached groups of nodes)  <2>

<1> in technical terms, nodes with a `degree` of less than 10.
<2> in technical terms, we are looking for the `giant component`

image::filter-degree-range-1-en.png[align="center",title="Filter on degree"]

image::filter-giant-component-1-en.png[align="center",title="Filter on giant component"]

We will see that the placement on the filters in the zone will make a difference.

First, let us place the filter on giant component *inside* the filter on degree:

image::filter-order-1-en.png[align="center",title="Filters in one configuration"]

In this first case,

- only the giant component of the network was made visible.

-> Since the network was just one big connected "island" to start with, it did not change a thing.

- then, all characters with more than 10 relations where hidden

-> this hides nodes which were connecting with many others, so that we end up with many groups, disconnected from each others.

//+

Now instead, placing the filter degree *inside* the filter on giant component:

image::filter-order-2-en.png[align="center",title="Same filters in another configuration"]

In this second case,

- starting from the complete network, all characters with more than 10 relations where deleted.

-> this created a network made of many disconnected groups of nodes

- then the giant component filter is applied,

-> which had for effect to hide small groups, to keep in view only the biggest group of connected nodes.

//+

WARNING: In summary: be careful how you apply several filters at once, this might have an effect on the logic of filtering.

== filter operators

==== 1. The MASK operator

Imagine you are interested in the female characters of the novel "Les Miserables".

- you are interested in female characters and the relations among them
- you are interested in the relations between female characters and male characters
- you are *not* interested in the relations between male characters

How to display this?

//+
The MASK operator applied on the gender partition filter enables you to:

- show all characters
- relations between female characters
- _and relations between male and female characters_
- _but masking male-male relations_

image::operator-mask-1-en.png[align="center",title="Using the MASK operator"]

It is also possible to hide / show only some of the directed relations between the visible graph and the filtered out graph:

image::operator-mask-2-en.png[align="center",title="Parameters of the MASK operator"]

==== 2. The UNION operator

Imagine you are interested in the characters with names starting with "L" or "J" in "Les Miserables".

How to display only these characters?

//+
We will need to apply filters on the `Label` of the nodes, which contains the names of the characters.

However, looking at the "catalogue" of filters, we see no filter on `Label`. The reason is that `Label` is an internal property of nodes, inaccessible to filters.

So we must first copy the Labels of the nodes in a new attribute, which we will be able to  apply a filter on.

Let's switch to the data laboratory and add this attribute:

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1j3B2ahLGqEYBGDqDyBcVOj8-Xp1oJGER8AnIudCvuZM/pub?w=1136&h=646[align="center",title="Adding a column for Names"]

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1zYQs7U_Vlf8KfZcI4Btr0fo1JgQcrLjrkx5a8Jt_eV4/pub?w=1136&h=646[align="center",title="Copying to this new column"]

We now have an attribute called "Name" that we can find in the Filters:

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17zSqYMEEe5K34mWssyWpPRbRffX42U5eHjY5vvtfMuc/pub?w=1031&h=627[align="center",title="New filter available"]

This is how the filter on Name and its parameters look like in the zone:

image::filter-name-1-en.png[align="center",title="Name Filter"]

To recall, we want to show only the characters which name start with "L" or "J". Let's start with the "L" characters.

We need to find the names which match the pattern *`Start with an L`*. The way to describe a pattern in text is called a "regular expression".

Said differently, _a regular expressions (also called "regex") is a convenient way to express a pattern we search for in a text_.

//+
Regular expressions can become very sophisticated. But here, we need just a simple one:

[source,regex]
L.*

Let's examine what the L, the dot and the star mean.

//+

- the letter "L" means we want names starting with this first letter
- . the dot means: any character
- * the star means: the previous character, repeated any time.

So: "select nodes which have a name starting with L, followed by any character, in any number"

//+
Please note that you need to check the box "regex":

image::filter-name-2-en.png[align="center",title="Using a regular expression in a filter"]

When the filter is applied, only the characters wit a name starting with L will be displayed:

image::filter-name-3-en.png[align="center",title="Using a regular expression in a filter"]

How to filter characters with a name starting with the letter "L" or "J"?

We could rely on a more complex regular expression to do this:

[source,regex]
[LJ].*

Meaning: "select nodes which have a name starting with L or J, followed by any characters"

//+
But we can also rely on 2 filters: one for L, one for J. Nesting one inside another would not work, it would mean:

"show nodes which start with an L, and among them, only those which start with a J"

-> no node can meet this condition, so they would all be invisible.

//+
Instead, we should use the *`UNION`* operator that can be found here:

image::filter-operator-union-1-en.png[align="center",title="The UNION operator in filters"]

Drag it to the zone, and then drag inside it twice the `Attributes -> Equal -> Name` filter:

image::filter-operator-union-2-en.png[align="center",title="The UNION operator and 2 subfilters"]

In the settings of the first Name filter, put the regular expression:

[source,regex]
L.*

In the second Name filter, put:

[source,regex]
J.*

(make sure the "regex" box is checked in both cases)

//+
As a result, the nodes  selected by both filters are added up in the display:

image::filter-operator-union-3-en.png[align="center",title="The UNION operator and 2 subfilters"]

==== 3. The NOT operator

The NOT operator flips the result of a filter: what was hidden becomes visible and vice and versa.

//+
Example: if we want to display all characters except for those returned by a UNION on 2 Name filters on L and J initials:

image::filter-operator-not-3-en.png[align="center",title="The NOT nodes operator - 1"]

Same effect, but applying the NOT operator on single filter using a regex on L or J:

image::filter-operator-not-1-en.png[align="center",title="The NOT nodes operator - 2"]

Same effect again, achieved without using the NOT operator. In regular expressions the ^ sign inside square brackets means "NOT":

[source,regex]
[^LJ].*
