//ST: !

This plugin is created by https://www.clementlevallois.net[Clement Levallois].

It converts a spreadsheet or a csv file into a network.

//ST: !

This plugin enables you to:

*   Start from a data table in Excel or csv format
*   In the data table, nodes are the entities listed in column A
*   Nodes' attributes must be listed in columns B, C, D, etc.
*   Connections will be created between nodes, when they have identical attributes.
*   Attributes can have values, stored in columns right next to the attribute.

== How is the similarity computed, exactly?
//ST: How is the similarity computed, exactly?

We use the cosine similarity. Sounds complicated, but it is not. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746501/can-someone-give-an-example-of-cosine-similarity-in-a-very-simple-graphical-wa[Check here].

The source code for the cosine calculation is in this https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins/blob/master-forge/modules/SimilarityComputer/src/main/java/net/clementlevallois/computer/CosineCalculation.java[file], at https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins/blob/master-forge/modules/SimilarityComputer/src/main/java/net/clementlevallois/computer/CosineCalculation.java#L110[this place].

== FAQ / special notes on the plugin
//ST: FAQ / special notes on the plugin
//ST: !

==== 1. Excel files should be .xlsx, not .xls

Because they represent two slightly different files formats, and the plugin supports only .xlsx

//ST: !

==== 2. csv files are ok.

If you select a http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001356.htm[csv file], you will be asked to indicate the field delimiter and optionally the text delimiter.

//ST: !

==== 3. You can't use numerical values in the attributes

image::en/similarity-computer/numerical-attributes-en.png[align="center", title="Age is a numerical attribute"]

This is too bad. If there is enough demand for it I'll add this feature, which is not trivial.

//ST: !

==== 4. Each entity should appear only on one line

image::en/similarity-computer/plugin-7-en.png[align="center", title="An entity appearing twice"]

David appears on lines 2 and 5 (because he made two purchases). Only the latest line where David appears (line 5) will be taken into account.
