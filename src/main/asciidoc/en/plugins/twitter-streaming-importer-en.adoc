== Description of the plugin

//ST: Author and documentation

This plugin is created by https://matthieu-totet.fr[Matthieu Totet], who is a long time community member of Gephi (check his https://github.com/totetmatt/GephiStreamer[Gephi Streamer]!)

You can find additional documentation on this plugin on https://matthieu-totet.fr/Koumin/2016/04/25/twitter-streaming-importer-naoyun-as-a-gephi-plugin/[Matthieu's website].

//ST: Description of the plugin

This plugin enables you to:

*   Collect tweets in realtime, on the topic you choose
*   Get the connections between the users mentionned in these tweets
*   Visualize these connections in Gephi, or just export all the tweets to Excel

== Installing the plugin

//ST: Installing the plugin

//ST: !
[WARNING]
The setup of the plugin will need you to create a Twitter account, if you don't already have one.
Get your Twitter login and password ready. **You also need a mobile phone number where your Twitter account can be confirmed**.

//ST: !
[CAUTION]
====
Setting up a Twitter account and creating a Twitter app is a boring task.

It takes just 15 minutes, and you have to do it just once. Then you'll have Twitter at your fingertips.

Let's go!

//ST: !

[WARNING]
You have received an email by Twitter about the sign up. At some point (but now would be a good time), you must click on the link in this email to confirm it.

//ST: !

The next screens of the sign up for Twitter are not important for us.
Just follow the steps until you get to the page showing your Twitter profile, meaning the setup is finished.



//ST: !

[[twitter-account-finished-setup]]
You now have a Twitter account.
We need to create a Twitter app which will authorize us to collect tweets automatically via Gephi

icon:thumbs-up[] Well done. This setup had just to be done once.
Now we can start using the plugin.

== Using the plugin

//ST: !

Be careful that if you choose very common terms, tweets will arrive fast and in large volumes.
If you don't have enough memory (RAM) on your computer, this could make it crash.
Click on "disconnect" to stop the collection of tweets.


//ST: !

//ST: Applying a layout while the tweets arrive.

You can see the users organize spatially in real time, while the tweets are being collected.

Just run Force Atlas 2 in the "Layout" panel. This will not interrupt the collection of tweets.
