== Update

[TIP]
====
This plugin has been replaced by a new and better function available on the web, developed by the same author. It is free, click and point, without registration at this address: https://nocodefunctions.com/gaze/network_builder_tool.html[https://nocodefunctions.com]

== Presentation of the plugin

This plugin is created by https://www.clementlevallois.net[Clement Levallois].

It converts a spreadsheet or a csv file into a network.

This plugin enables you to:

//+
*   Start from a data table in Excel or csv format
*   In the data table, each row describes an "occurrence" (of an event, a purchase, a relation, etc.)
//+
*   In columns A, B, C, D, we have the entities involved: column A for persons, column B for what they bought, etc.
*   Connections will be created between entities, when they appear in the same occurrence (so, when they are on thee same row)
*   Occurrences can have dates, multiple instances of an entity can be listed in a given column.

== Using the plugin

==== 2nd panel

image::excel-1-en.png[align="center", title="A file with headers"]

To describe the next screens of the plugin, we will take the example of *the Excel file just shown*, with headers.

==== 3rd panel
image::plugin-panels-1-en.png[align="center", title="Which entities should be the nodes?"]

What does this panel mean?

If you look back at the Excel file, you see that we have "Clients" and their "Purchases".

//+
-> This means we can build 2 different types of networks, depending on our needs:

1. A network showing clients and products, with relations representing purchases from a client to a product.


//+
[graphviz, client-to-product, png]
----
graph g {
    rankdir="LR";
    client -- product [ label="purchased" ]
}
----

//+
To create this kind of networks, choose "Client" in the upper window, and "Purchases" in the lower window of the plugin screen.


//+
[start=2]
2. Or a network where 2 products are connected, if one client puchased them together.

//+
[graphviz, product-to-product, png]
----
graph g {
    rankdir="LR";
    a -- b [label=" purchased together"]
     a [label="product 1"];
     b [label="product 2"];
}
----

//+
To create this kind of networks, choose "Purchases" in the upper [underline]#and# lower windows of the plugin screen.

==== 4th panel
image::subfield-delimiter-en.png[align="center", title="Choosing which delimiter is used"]

This 3rd panel asks: in our Excel file, how are different items separated in a given cell?
In our example, we have used commas: the lists of products purchased are comma-separated:

image::https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tRw85HuODUSCD7e48UX_F7fUB5XWGJ7hVzNFnr6oWQI/pub?w=656&h=377[align="center", title="commas shown in red"]

==== 5th panel
This panel allows you to specify whether the relations are dynamic in time, or not.

In this case, you need an extra column (column C), where a date is shown. We don't cover this case here.

(read the tutorials on dynamic networks for a starter)

==== 6th panel
image::panel-6-1-en.png[align="center", title="Options panel"]

 "Create links between Purchases agents and links between Purchase agents"

-> If you chose a Product <--> Product kind of network in panel 3, then of course you are interested in links between products. *Check the box*.

//+
-> But if you chose a Client <--> Product kind of network  in panel 3, what you need is less obvious.

Let's take the example of client I, who purchased a table and some chairs:

1. Checking the box will create a network where:

//+
[graphviz, inner-links-included, png]
----
graph g {
    rankdir="LR";
    a -- b [label=" purchased"]
    a -- c [label=" purchased"]
    b -- c [label=" co-purchased"]

     a [label="client I"];
     b [label="table"];
     c [label="chairs"];

}
----

//+
1. *Not* checking the box will create a network where:

//+
[graphviz, inner-links-excluded, png]
----
graph g {
    rankdir="LR";
    a -- b [label=" purchased"]
    a -- c [label=" purchased"]

     a [label="client I"];
     b [label="table"];
     c [label="chairs"];

}
----

//+
 "Remove duplicates"

-> Check this option if your Excel or csv file has duplicate rows that you'd like to be removed

//+
 "Remove self-loops"

If a Client has purchased tables twice, so that we have "table, table" in a cell: this would create a link from table to table (a *self loop*).

-> Check this option if you'd like self loops to be removed.

==== 7th panel
This panel recaps all the settings. Click on finish to create the network.
