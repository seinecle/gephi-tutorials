== Gephi workshops
I organize online workshops and personalized trainings for Gephi, for beginners and experts.
To schedule one or to get more information: analysis@exploreyourdata.com.

== Importing an existing network file
Gephi handles the import of network files in a variety of formats:

image::network-formats-gephi-import-en.png[align="center",title="file formats supported by Gephi. Source: gephi.org"]

To import any of these files, just choose the `File -> Open` menu

==  Importing nodes with labels and their relations: simplest version
(looking for the complete, full featured csv import version? <<full-csv-version, skip to here>>.)

The easiest is probably to just have a text file like this one:

//+
----
Source,Target <1>
Jeremy,Jennifer
Valerian,Jeremy
----

<1> This line is mandatory. Don't put a space between the comma and "Target"

//+
Just write this in a text editor and save it as a file `example.txt`

To import this file in Gephi, go to `File->Import Spreadsheet`. Then in the window:

In this window, make sure the box "Create missing nodes" is checked:

[[full-csv-version]]

Let's look again at the simple text file we used:

//+
....
Source,Target
Jeremy,Jennifer
Valerian,Jeremy
....

There are 2 issues and several missing features, listed below:

==== 1. labels containing commas in them will not work.

Imagine our characters have first names and last names separated by a comma:

Dubois, Jeremy

Rodriguez, Valerian

//+
This will look like:

....
Source,Target
Dubois, Jeremy,Jeremy,Jennifer
Rodriguez, Valerian,Dubois, Jeremy
....

//+
Note that we have 3 commas per line, instead of one!
In this mess, Gephi will not detect where the node labels start and end.
The import will break.

//+
The proper solution is to put node labels inside *double quotes*:

//+
....
Source,Target
"Dubois, Jeremy","Jeremy,Jennifer"
"Rodriguez, Valerian","Dubois, Jeremy"
....

//+
Be careful to use these straight " " double quotes, not the curvy ones: “ ” which French keyboards sometimes have.

==== 2. labels containing double quotes " " in them will not work.

Example: let's imagine that one of our characters has a middle name: Jeremy "Danger" Dubois.
Our text file will look like:

//+
....
Source,Target
"Dubois, Jeremy "Danger"","Jeremy,Jennifer"
"Rodriguez, Valerian","Dubois, Jeremy "Danger""
....

//+
These extra " " will make the Gephi import break:

image::import-spreadsheet-4-en.png[align="center",title="The import bugs - the middle name has disappeared"]

The solution consists in *adding an extra double quote in front of the double quotes*.
Our text file will look like:

//+
....
Source,Target
"Dubois, Jeremy ""Danger""","Jeremy,Jennifer"
"Rodriguez, Valerian","Dubois, Jeremy ""Danger"""
....

//+
This time, Gephi imports the network correctly:

== Importing more than labels: nodes and edges attributes
To import attributes we will need to proceed differently.

We need 2 text files: one for the list of nodes, one for the list of relations (edges)

An example file with a list of nodes:

//+
....
Id,Label,Date of Birth,Place of Birth,Years of experience,Rating <1>
3,"Dubois, Jeremy ""Danger""",17/09/1980,"Paris",8,9.27
1,"Jeremy,Jennifer",25/03/1978,"Tampa",8,4.34
45,"Rodriguez, Valerian",30/04/1985,"Berlin",5,6.66
....

<1> Nodes *must* have at least an Id and a Label. Don't put spaces after the commas

//+
An example file with a list of edges:

//+
....
Source,Target,Weight,Type,Where first met <1>
1,45,3,"undirected",London <2>
....
<1> Edges *must* have at least a Source and Target. Other fields are optional.
<2> "undirected", the alternative is "directed". Directed edges have arrow heads.

//+
Let's import the list of nodes first. `File -> Import Spreadsheet`

in the next screen, we must be careful with a couple of things:

Then we can import the file with the list of relations. `File -> Import Spreadsheet`

== Memo card
Nodes

- header must be at least `Id,Label`

//+
Edges

- header must be at least `Source,Target`
- To have an attribute for the "thickness" or "strength" of a relation, this attribute must be called "Weight".
- Want arrows on your links? Add an attribute "Type", with value "Directed"
- Don't wan't arrows? Add an attribute "Type", with value "Undirected"

//+
Types of attributes: which to choose?

image::import-spreadsheet-9-en.png[align="center",title="Kinds of attributes"]

- Textual attribute: `String`. Nodes sharing the same textual value can be colored the same, or filtered together...
- Numerical attribute: `Integer`, `Double` or `Float`. Nodes can be resized according to their value, or colorized in a gradient. Filters can be applied based on the range of values.
- Boolean attribute: just a `true` or `false` value. Useful for filtering out some nodes which are true or false on some parameter.
- Other types of attributes: not needed for the moment.
