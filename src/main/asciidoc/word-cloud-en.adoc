== What does it do?
This plugin helps you explore a network where the nodes have a textual attribute.
Let's take the example of a network of 3,000 twitter users, where each user would have their bio in an attribute called "description".

//+
You open the network, spatialize it with Force Atlas... then you try to make sense of it.
Who are these twitter users in different parts of the network?

//+
- __without__ the plugin, you need to make frequent back and forth between the Overview and the Data Laboratory to see the description of the nodes.

//+
- __with__ the plugin, a window opens in the Overview, and it shows a word cloud of the descriptions of the nodes you are currently selecting with the mouse.
*At a glance, you can visualize and understand the most prominent keywords associated with the Twitter accounts your mouse is selecting: it becomes clear who these persons are and what they relate to.*


== When to use it?
This plugin is the most useful when:

1. the nodes have a textual attribute, where the text is pretty long for each node. A description of the node, typically.
2. the network has a couple of hundreds of nodes at least
3. you don't know perfectly the network

//+
Conditions 2 and 3 reflect the fact that if the network is very small or if you know it very well, you don't really need help to explore it :-)

== How to use it?

Dr. Veronica Espinoza has published a https://medium.com/@vespinozag/how-to-use-word-cloud-plugin-for-gephi-6f14c7c052e3[great tutorial about it - go check it].

== Where does it come from?
The plugin was developed from scratch by https://twitter.com/seinecle[Clement Levallois] (the author of these Gephi tutorials) on Twitch from October 2022 to March 2023.
