== Gephi workshops
I organize online workshops and personalized trainings for Gephi, for beginners and experts.
To schedule one or to get more information: analysis@exploreyourdata.com.

== 1. The birth of Gephi
The origin of Gephi lays in http://webatlas.fr/wp/[Web Atlas], a project started in 2006 involving https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-jacomy-a38a552a/[Mathieu Jacomy], who was interested in the exploration of web-based graphs.

This was about the same time http://www.cond.org/[Eytan Adar] was developing his https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjljNmDtbrRAhXL6xQKHWDdDRMQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphexploration.cond.org%2Fchi2006%2Fguess-chi2006.pdf&usg=AFQjCNETmuZqHoaZyJSYpSuTGQ87PNSCLA&sig2=ns0z9wqVRIo5riVtHv1QfQ[GUESS software]

In 2007/2008, this project morphed into Gephi, developed by a team of students at Université Technologique de Compiègne (https://www.utc.fr/en.html[UTC]).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieubastian/[Mathieu Bastian] became the software architect.

== 2. The evolution of Gephi
Gephi has evolved in several major milestones:

==== a. version 0.6 (2009)
- the initial public release. Contains already the filter system.

==== b. version 0.7 (2010)
- Major overhaul of the graphics interface.
- Started using OpenGL framework for graphics acceleration.
- A system of plugin is created.

==== c. version 0.8 (2011)
- Introduced dynamic graphs.
- Many plugins were created for Gephi, and the software started becoming much popular.
- Mac computer users had issues installing Gephi on their computers because of a Java compatibility issue.

==== d. version 0.9 (December 2015):
- A graph engine optimized for memory is introduced: Gephi can handle much larger graphs.
- The codebase for the project is "mavenized", making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Compatibility issues with Mac OS are solved.

In 2016, Gephi is translated in French, Spanish, Japanese,  Russian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech and German.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-ramos-ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez-b6231522/[Eduardo Ramos Ibáñez] is the maintainer of the code.
