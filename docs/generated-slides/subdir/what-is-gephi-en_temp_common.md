== the leading software to visualize networks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers

//ST: the leading desktop software to visualize and explore networks
- more than 2 million downloads,
- used by analysts, academics, journalists,
- stable on Windows, Mac and Linux,
- in continuous development


== open source & free (including for commercial purposes)

//ST: open source & free (including for commercial purposes)

Gephi adopts a licencing model which makes it free to use, sell, or include the source code of Gephi in larger applications.

Developers who modify the Gephi code base are required to make these changes public, to benefit the community.


== "Photoshop^TM^ for graphs"

//ST: "Photoshop^TM^ for graphs"

- for networks of all types (social, semantic, biological, etc.)
- attributes and properties of the network are made visible: not just the http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/topologies.asp[topology] of the network.
- Gephi provides functions to explore the network: pan, filter, zoom, colorize, label, etc.
- measures and metrics can be computed, and then rendered visually.


== committed to quality and performance

//ST: committed to quality and performance

- Gephi won a http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/dukeschoicewinners-171159.html[Duke Award in 2010]. Duke awards "recognize and honor extreme innovation in the world of Java technology".
- Gephi evolved importantly since 2006 to adopt new, best performing techs for the visualization of very large graphs on the desktop
- The code base of Gephi is maintained with the best standards to insure a https://gephi.wordpress.com/tag/code/[a stable application, ease of maintainance and modularity / extensibility].


== modular and extensible

//ST: modular and extensible

- Gephi is "cut" in a large number of modules, each providing a specific function. This makes it easier to maintain and evolve the software, by working on independent parts.
- Since version 0.9 the https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/gephi-boosts-its-performance-with-new-graphstore-core/["graph store"] of Gephi has become a completely independent module: it can be reused by another software.
- Anybody can create new modules for Gephi! https://gephi.org/plugins/#/[They are called "plugins"]. They integrate with Gephi seamlessly.

== created, maintained and documented by volunteers, for the community.

//ST: created, maintained and documented by volunteers, for the community.

- Gephi itself is open source and free
- The https://consortium.gephi.org/[Gephi Consortium] was created to ensure Gephi will remain so
- The https://github.com/gephi/gephi/graphs/contributors[original contributors and their followers] are volunteers
- The support to users through http://forum-gephi.org/[forums], https://www.facebook.com/groups/gephi/[discussion groups] and https://gephi.org/users/[documents] is provided for free.
